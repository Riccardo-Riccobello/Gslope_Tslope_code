# Gslope_Tslope_code
In this Repository you can find the Gslope and Tslope code, two new algorithms on Gaussian Graphical Models topics.

In order to run the code you should follow the next steps:
- Load the "Official_runner.R" (This is the core of all the other codes - There are 10k lines of code to run all the simulations)
- Enter in the "Data_simulation" folder and choose what you want to run (If you want to run simple simulations, you can refer to the "Simulation Runner - TEMPLATE.R" in the "Data_simulation" folder)
